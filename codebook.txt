The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket 
of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) 
on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear 
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have
been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise 
filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 
readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion 
components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and 
gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 
features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

In this exercise the final data set is called AverageMeanStdDataset.csv which hold the 
average of measures of mean and standard deviation features for each activity and each subject.
The following is the detail description of each variable
	
	Activity : 
		1 : WALKING
		2 : WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		3 : WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		4 : SITTING
		5 : STANDING
		6 : LAYING
			 
	Subject : 1 - 30 represents each individual volunteers
	
	Features :
		The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 
		3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' 
		to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered
		using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner 
		frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then 
		separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

		Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in 
		time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the 
		magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean 
		norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

		Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing
		fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, 
		fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

		These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
		'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
		Here is the list of signal:
			tBodyAcc-XYZ
			tGravityAcc-XYZ
			tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
			tBodyGyro-XYZ
			tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
			tBodyAccMag
			tGravityAccMag
			tBodyAccJerkMag
			tBodyGyroMag
			tBodyGyroJerkMag
			fBodyAcc-XYZ
			fBodyGyro-XYZ
			fBodyAccMag
			fBodyAccJerkMag
			fBodyGyroMag
			fBodyGyroJerkMag
			
		Two variables were estimated for each signal:
		Average of SIGNAL mean() : average of mean value of each activity and each subject
		Average of SiGNAL std() : average of standard deviation of each activity and 
		                          each subject
		                          
	    For example: 
	        There are "Avg of tBodyAcc-mean()-X" and  "Avg of tBodyAcc-std()-X" variables 
	        for tBodyAcc-X signal
